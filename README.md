• Developed a Linux kernel module to register multiple platform devices with custom metadata (size, permissions, serial number) using `platform_add_devices()` and `platform_data`.
• Implemented device lifecycle management with release callbacks and structured initialization/cleanup routines.
• Demonstrated understanding of platform driver binding and board-level device provisioning in Embedded Linux.
